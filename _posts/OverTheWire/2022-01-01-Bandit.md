# Bandit 4 → Bandit 5 

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere**  directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

1. first navigate to `inhere` directory
2. list the files with `ls` command
3. we can use for loop instead of checking each file individually
   1. `for i in {0..9}; do file -- "-file0$i" ; done`
4. we can see that “-file07” is ASCII file, we can view it’s content using `cat -- -file07` command
   1. `--` to say that this is the end of options

# Bandit 12→ Bandit 13 

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

* first, we will create a directory inside /tmp
*   cp data.txt to our directory

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 17.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    ***
* alright, let's search for any program to deal with hexdump
*   we can use `**apropos hexdump**`

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 18.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
* great, it seems `xxd` will help us here
*   lets learn more about it using `--help` option

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 19.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    * we found `-r` option allow us to reverse
    * `xxd -r data.txt > data` reverse the hexdump and redirect the output to “data” file

    ***
*   let’s check the file type using `file data` command, it’s gzip compressed data, so we will rename the file to “data.gz”

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 20.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    * unzip “data.gz” using `gzip --decompress data.gz`

    ***
*   there are three steps we will do after any decompress

    1. Chck the file format using `**file <file name>**`
    2. rename the file with it’s format extention (gzip → .gz, bzip2 → bz2, POSIX → tar.gz)
    3. decompress the file (`gzip -d` or `tar -xvf` or `bzip2 -d`)

    ***
*   gzip decompress

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 21.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    ***
* bzip2 decompress
*   after checking the file type again we will see it is bzip2 file, so let’s rename the file to “data.bz2”

    * `**bandit12@bandit:/tmp/juba$ mv compressed.bz compressed.bz2**`

# Bandit 13 → Bandit 14 

* The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit\_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** **localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
* We don’t need the Bandit14 password, we have his ssh private key, so we can use it to login
* `**ssh -i <ssh key> <username>@<host>**`

*   as we can see this script will change the mode to 644 for a file called “t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv” in /tmp, then will cat bandit22 password and redirect it to this file

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 54.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
*   It’s very easy to access the password, just read the file “/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv”

# Bandit 22 → Bandit 23 

* A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
* **NOTE:** Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.
*   we can remember cron.d directory from the previous level

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 52.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
*   let’s check the cronjob\_bandit23 file

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 56.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
*   view /usr/bin/cronjob\_bandit23.sh

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 57.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    * line 1: shebang
    * line4: save the user name in a variable called myname
    * line5: hash the text “I am user username“ using md5sum hash algorithm then split the output and save the output in a variable called mytarget
      *   to demonstrate this we will try it by ourself

          <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 58.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
      *   if we don’t cut the output we will see this output:

          <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 59.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
    * line 7: print “Copying password file /etc/bandit\_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget”
    *   line 9: cat his password and redirect it to /tmp/$mytarget

        ***
* we know that bandit23 is running this cronjob, so it’s obvious that myname variable is “bandit23”, Let’s assign this value using `**myname=bandit23**`
*   let’s continue the script by assigning mytarget variable using `mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)`

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 60.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

# Bandit 23 → Bandit 24 

* A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
* **NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!
* **NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is **removed** **once executed**, so you may want to keep a copy around…
*   Let’s navigate to /etc/cron.d to see all cron jobs

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 62.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    * well, let’s show cronjob\_bandit24 content

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 63.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
*   let’s check /usr/bin/cronjob\_bandit24.sh

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 64.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    * the main functionality of this script is executing all the files in /var/spool/$myname and deleting them, in our case $myname is bandit24 he executes this script
* let’s write our script and save it in /tmp/our\_dir because the script will remove it automatically
* we can create our script by typing `touch <script name>.sh`
*   all we need is bandit24 password, so we can type this small script

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash 
    cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/juba/done  
    ```
* before coping this script to /var/spool/bandit24 we need to give it executable permissions by typing `chmod a+x get_pass.sh`
* if bandit24 executes this script he can’t write on /tmp/juba/done so we should give him write permissions `touch done ; chmod a+w done`
* coping the file `cp get_pass.sh /var/spool/bandit24/`
*   great, we have got the password

# Bandit 24 → Bandit 25 

* A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
* First, we should generate all the possible combinations of 4 digits, we can generate it using this simple script `for i in {0000..9999}; do echo $i >> wordlist.txt ; done`
* great, now we have all the possible combinations let’s try to get the password by connecting to port 30002 using netcat
*   if we connected without any input we will see the following

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 66.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
* sorry, it seems we need bandit24 password too, let’s get it using `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24` and regenerate the list using `for i in {0000..9999}; do echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i" >> list ; done`

# Bandit 25 → Bandit 26 

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works, and how to break out of it.

*   we found bandit26 ssh key in bandit 25 home directory

    ```bash
    bandit25@bandit:~$ ls 
    bandit26.sshkey
    ```
*   we can check the shell for user bandit26 by viewing /etc/passwd file

    <img src="/assets/images/OverTheWire/Bandit/Untitled 69.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
* as we can see bandit26 uses /usr/bin/showtext shell

    Welcome to OverTheWire!

    If you find any problems, please report them to Steven or morla on
    irc.overthewire.org.

    --[ Playing the games ]--

      This machine might hold several wargames.
      If you are playing "somegame", then:

        * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
        * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
        * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

      Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
      working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
      command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
      directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
      so that users can not snoop on eachother. Files and directories with
      easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted!

      Please play nice:

        * don't leave orphan processes running
        * don't leave exploit-files laying around
        * don't annoy other players
        * don't post passwords or spoilers
        * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
          This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

    --[ Tips ]--

      This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
      by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
      compiler flags might be interesting:

        -m32                    compile for 32bit
        -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
        -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

      In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
      executable on ELF binaries.

      Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
      firewall.

    --[ Tools ]--

     For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
     in the following locations:

        * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /usr/local/gef/
        * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /usr/local/pwndbg/
        * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /usr/local/peda/
        * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /usr/local/gdbinit/
        * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
        * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
        * checksec.sh (http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html) in /usr/local/bin/checksec.sh

    --[ More Information ]--

Congratulations on solving the last level of this game! At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon. Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels! In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames. If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!

**At this moment, level 34 does not exist yet.**
